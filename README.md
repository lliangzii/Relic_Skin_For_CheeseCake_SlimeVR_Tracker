# Relic_Skin_For_CheeseCake_SlimeVR_Tracker
There are skins for CheeseCake SlimeVR tracker's PCB, the original Repo did not including ICM45686, I add it. 

## Usage
To have the colorful silkscreen, you should order PCB on JLCPCB:  
https://prodocs.easyeda.com/en/pcb/other-draw-colorful-silkscreen/#order-colorful-silkscreen-pcb

Sometimes the colorful silkscreen for 1mm PCB thickness may too expensive, you can use Case_TypeC_1.6mm.stl for 1.6mm PCB thickness. If you use this Case, DO NOT use Li-po battery >8.4mm thickness!

You can edit the PCB with EasyEDA PRO Editor (import the .epro file) : https://easyeda.com/

Hope your soul never fade away~~
